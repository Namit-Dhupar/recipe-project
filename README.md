# E-commerce Recipe Builder

This repository contains the source code and assets for the E-commerce Recipe Builder web application.

## Technologies Involved

The E-commerce Recipe Builder application utilizes the following technologies:

- **ReactJS/Redux**: The front-end of the application is built using ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux is used for state management, allowing for efficient data flow and handling complex application states.

- **React Router Dom**: React Router Dom is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages of the application without the need for a server round-trip.

- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy loading techniques are implemented to improve the application's performance. This allows for the on-demand loading of resources, such as images or components, when they are needed.

- **User Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using Google Firebase authentication. This ensures secure access to the application and enables personalized user experiences.

- **Google Firebase**: Google Firebase is used as the backend service for the application. It provides various features, such as real-time database storage, authentication, and hosting, which are leveraged to power the E-commerce Recipe Builder application.
